This is a game designed to help you learn how to use the linux command line.

Yousef: add instructions for how to invoke your front end.

Requirements:
 - Bash (known to work as far back as 3.2)
 - GNU coreutils (or equivalent)
 - Perl
 - probably other things (let me know when it breaks, and send me any errors you see)
