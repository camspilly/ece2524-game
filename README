This is a game designed to help you learn how to use the linux command line.

Youssef: Add instructions for how to invoke your front end!!!

In the mean time, to test only the shell-wrapper subsystem, type:

    GAME_LEVEL_DIR=levels/santa ./shell-wrapper/run.sh

Requirements:
 - Bash (known to work as far back as 3.2)
 - GNU coreutils (or equivalent)
 - Perl
 - probably other things (let me know when it breaks, and send me any errors you see)
