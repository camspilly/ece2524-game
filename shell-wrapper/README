# Invocation

start by running `run.sh`


# Environment

* GAME_LEVEL_DIR - shall be set to a level directory (for example levels/santa)


# Exit codes

* 32 - user succeeded
* 33 - user gave up
* 16 - restart without header (only used internally)
anything else should be regarded as an internal error
(quite likely because of missing dependencies)


# Notes

This is embarrassingly hacky, and horribly unportable.
