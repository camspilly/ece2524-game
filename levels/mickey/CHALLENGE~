Mickey and Minnie Mouse are about to 
present the first episode of the
season of their show.

MICKEY MOUSE: Hi I'm Mickey Mouse
and this is my girlfriend Minnie!

MINNIE: Hi I'm Minnie Mou--

Porky pig pulls out a rifle
and shoots Minnie in the tuchus.

Minnie drops to the floor.

MICKEY: Oh no! Minnie!

Porky pig takes aim at Mickey now.
Mickey raises his hands in shock,
hoping Porky will calm down.

PORKY: H-hi-hi (stutter)
Mickey! I was wondering if you could
ma-ke-ke-ke me a-a-a "home" (directory)
to live in?

MICKEY: Uhhh... Sure Porky. Just
put the gun down.

Help Mickey to quickly make a "home" for
Porky before he kills him too.
