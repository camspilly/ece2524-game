James can be heard speaking his
part of the Team Rocket motto.

JAMES: And make it double!
JAMES: To unite all peoples within 
our nation!
JAMES: To extend our reach to the 
stars above!
JAMES: James!

Meanwhile, a distressed Jessie can be
heard off to the side of the
Team Rocket Headquarters.  
JESSIE: Oh no James! I think you might
have developed tourettes!
JESSIE: Oh if only I knew how to help
him!
Jessie wipes away two tears running
down her cheek.

MEOWTH: Meowth! That's right!
JESSIE: Oh shut up, Meowth or 
you'll end up getting it too!

An omnipotent being chimes in on
the situation.
OMNIPOTENT BEING: Help Jesse with
James tourette's problem by finding
a medication to {{{command:clear}}} 
James's mouth.
