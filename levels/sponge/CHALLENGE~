A quarrel is brewing in the Krusty 
Krab.
Patrick can be seen brawling with
the Krusty Krab restaurant telephone.

PATRICK: HEY TELEPHONE! 
THIS IS NOT
THE KRUSTY KRAB!
THIS IS PATRICK!

Patrick, in his anguish, realizes
Mr. Krabs is standing right in front
of him.

MR. KRABS: What is the meaning
of this! Patrick, I thought
I told you needed
to take your "755" {{{command:chmod}}}
medications
so that you can perform your
"755" work tasks,
before coming to work!

Patrick immediately came to his senses
once he heard Mr. Krabs's voice.

Patrick with his head low said
PATRICK: Sorry Mr. Krabs.

Help to change Patrick's permissions
so that he is able to work
