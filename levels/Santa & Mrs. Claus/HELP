You should check out the Makefile (read it with less).

Figure out what target you need to use to make a present,
and what variable you need to set to select a type of present,
then invoke make(1) such that it makes a present.

If you messed up making a present, you might need to `make clean`
before trying again.

With just a little bit of reading documentation, everyone can
become a great elf!

(no, not the ELF file format :D)
