Hey there!  It's us, Santa and Mrs. Claus!

My elves have been really busy this
year, but they still haven't finished
all the presents in time!

One of my elves was working on a
system to save us all some time with
the very repetitive task of making
presents, but I didn't pay attention
when he taught me how to use it.

I think it had something to do with
a command called {{{command:make}}} and a file
called {{{file:Makefile}}}.


I hope you can figure it out.
We're counting on you!
