Cosmo and Wanda are trying to escape
Fairy Land. They slaughtered nearly 
every fairy in an effort to comply
with Timmy's wish that they would 
never ever be replaced.

Jorgen Von Strangle (the military guy
from the show who is really buff
and dresses in full camo always)
is on their tail as they fly away
from the mess they have caused.


* 10 minutes goes by *
They've almost reached the rainbow out
of Fairy Land and Cosmo stops in his
tracks. 

COSMO: Wanda! We have a problem.
WANDA: What Cosmo!
COSMO: I forgot where the exit is
and I've no idea where we are right
now.
WANDA: Well I can at least figure
out where we are right now. I just
don't remember the spell.

Help Wanda to find their current
location (directory).
