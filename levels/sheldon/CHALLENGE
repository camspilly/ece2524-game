Leonard: Hey there! You must be
         the new Linux intern the
         university hired to help
         us over winter break!
Sheldon Walks In
Sheldon: Oh bother Leonard
Leonard: What is it now Sheldon?
Sheldon: I'm so frustrated. You
         know how I am doing work
         with cartesian products
         for my research on the 
         Higgs-Boson Particle?
Leonard: Of course, thats all you've
         talked about the last month.
Sheldon: Well I have to manually enter
         all the cartesian products
         of 3 sets where each contains
         the numbers 1-9. I have to 
         put it into a text file. 
Leonard: Whats that, intern? You can a 
         one line command in linux to
         do that for him?
Sheldon: Well that preposterous. If it
         was that easy I would have 
         already done it.
Leonard: Whats that intern? You 
         bet your whole internship
         on the fact that you can 
         do this? Okay, well go for
         it! A little hint though,
         he does not need each
         number separated by any-
         thing. You can just make
         something like 123 where
         1, 2, and 3 are all dif-
         erent numbers. Also,
         simply make the output
         titled "output"
