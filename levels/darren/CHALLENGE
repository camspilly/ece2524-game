Darren: Ahahahah! You have finally
        reached me! DARREN, MASTER
        OF ALL THINGS *NIX RELATED!
        While the other challengers 
        were here to help you solve 
        their own problems I am 
        literally here because I know
        how to make the biggest, 
        baddest, and toughest *nix 
        commands. 
You: *shutters*
Darren: here is your question: Write
        a single line command to tell
        me what your top ten most used
        commands on your computer are.
        Since I am Darren, master of all 
        things *nix, just output your 
        answer in the shell, I will be 
        able to see it. Also, dont forget,
        its good UNIX practice to put a 
        space beetween each command.
