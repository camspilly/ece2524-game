Stewie: Aw Brian! Look who we have here!
Brian: Yeah, its a young linux user...
Stewie: Well he's gotten this far so
        he must be fairly good at *nix
Brian: Meh. Doubtful. He learned it all
       in college where he was probably
       perpetually drunk like I was.
Stewie: Well drunk or not, maybe he can
       help you with that little 
       'problem' you were having.
Brian: What problem?
Stewie: You know, the one with the girls!
Brian: OH YEAH! So listen kid, I have a 
       problem with calling girls back.
       I have 3 different black books and
       I can never remember whose number I
       put in what book. Can you help me
       consolidate my 3 books into just 1?
Stewie: For convience sake I will tell you 
        the names of them and what the 
        output should be called. They are:
        chicks, babes, and cougars. The
        output is My_Baby_Mamas

Brian: While you're at it put their names
       in alphatabetical order as well.
